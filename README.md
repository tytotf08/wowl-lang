# Wowl

Wowl - a language in development to speed up your math operations. Unique to all other languages in syntax and method of interpretation, it is built just so that you an easily perform complex mathematical operations.

Wowl is a combination of Wise and Owl. This was because, well, Wowl is pretty smart. 

Wowl is written entirely in node-js. Utilizing the file system module, it is lightweight, and yet entirely functional. With annotated, cleaned-up code, it's very easy for anyone to understand.

## Current Functionality

Wowl can interpret variables, and you can refer to them. Upon creating variables, the value is output onto the shell surface. This is so that when you calculate, when that's added to Wowl, you get the answer immediately.

## Syntax

To declare a variable in Wowl, you have the definition, followed by a colon, and then the value. Values can be variable names or just numbers.
